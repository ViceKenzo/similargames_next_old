            before. Also to find games they didn’t know were similar to the ones
            they already liked and played.

            Here’s a brief summary that shows some of the future plans we
            (currently) have in store for SimilarGames:
            <ul>
              <li>Platforms</li>
              <li>More stores, including consoles!</li>
              <li>
                Games that are not bound to a large store (E.g. World of
                Warcraft)
              </li>
              <li>
                Many, and many different methods to search and explore through
                the vast amounts of games out there
              </li>
              <li>
                Data Expansion. More data to be gathered for each individual
                game. For example: Full description, images, ...
              </li>
              <li>... And many more!</li>
